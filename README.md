# Hangman

Basic Hangman game that shows alphabet and a hidden word. User is unvited to guess the word within seven tries.
Used letters are shown on screen.
User can get a hint from the NavigationBar which shows a label with the hidden word definition got from the "Dictionary Api".
Also from the NavigationBar user can start a new game.
Layout components and constraints were defined programatically. 
Code organization, logic and division in other files are going to be improved when I improve my knowledge :)
I'm still a newbie :)
